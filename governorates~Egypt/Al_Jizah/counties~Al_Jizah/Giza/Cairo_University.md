> Cairo University (Arabic: جامعة القاهرة, romanized: Jāmiʿat al-Qāhira) 
> is Egypt's premier public university. 
> Its main campus is in Giza, immediately across the Nile from Cairo. 
> 
> It was founded on 21 December 1908; after being housed in various parts of Cairo, 
> its faculties, beginning with the Faculty of Arts, 
> were established on its current main campus in Giza in October 1929.
>
> The university was known as the Egyptian University from 1908 to 1940, 
> and King Fuad I University and Fu'ād al-Awwal University from 1940 to 1952. 
> The university is the second oldest institution of higher education in Egypt 
> after Al-Azhar University, notwithstanding the pre-existing higher professional schools 
> that later became constituent colleges of the university.
>
> The university was founded and funded as the Egyptian University 
> by a committee of private citizens with royal patronage in 1908 
> and became a state institution under King Fuad I in 1925. 
> 
> In 1940, four years following his death, 
> the university was renamed King Fuad I University in his honor. 
> It was renamed a second time after the 1952 Egyptian revolution. 
> 
> The university currently enrolls approximately 155,000 students in 20 faculties and 3 institutions. 
> It counts three Nobel Laureates among its graduates 
> and is one of the 50 largest institutions of higher education in the world by enrollment.
