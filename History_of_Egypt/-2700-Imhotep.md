> **Imhotep** (Ancient Egyptian: ỉỉ-m-ḥtp "(the one who) comes in peace"; fl. late 27th century BC) 
> was an Egyptian chancellor to the King Djoser, possible architect of Djoser's step pyramid, 
> and high priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis. 
> 
> Very little is known of Imhotep as a historical figure, 
> but in the 3,000 years following his death, he was gradually glorified and deified.
>
> Traditions from long after Imhotep's death treated him as a great author of wisdom texts and especially as a physician. 
> 
> No text from his lifetime mentions these capacities 
> and no text mentions his name in the first 1,200 years following his death. 
> 
> Apart from the three short contemporary inscriptions that establish him as chancellor to the Pharaoh, 
> the first text to refer to Imhotep dates to the time of [[-1387-Amenhotep_III-1350]] (c. 1391–1353 BC). 
> It is addressed to the owner of a tomb and reads:
>
> The wab-priest may give offerings to your ka. 
> The wab-priests may stretch to you their arms with libations on the soil, 
> as it is done for Imhotep with the remains of the water bowl.
>
> It appears that this libation to Imhotep was done regularly, 
> as they are attested on papyri associated with statues of Imhotep until the Late Period (c. 664–332 BC). 
> 
> Wildung (1977) explains the origin of this cult as a slow evolution of intellectuals' memory of Imhotep, 
> from his death onward. 
> 
> Gardiner finds the cult of Imhotep during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1077 BC) 
> sufficiently distinct from the usual offerings made to other commoners 
> that the epithet "demigod" is likely justified to describe his veneration.
>
> The first references to the healing abilities of Imhotep occur from the Thirtieth Dynasty (c. 380–343 BC) onward, 
> some 2,200 years after his death.
>
> Imhotep is among fewer than a dozen non-royal Egyptians who were deified after their deaths. 
> The center of his cult was in Memphis. 
> The location of his tomb remains unknown, despite efforts to find it. 
> The consensus is that it is hidden somewhere at Saqqara.
