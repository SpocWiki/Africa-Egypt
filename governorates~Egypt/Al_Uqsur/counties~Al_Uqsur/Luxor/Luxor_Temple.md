> The Luxor Temple (Arabic: معبد الأقصر) is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex 
> located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) 
> and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. 
> 
> In the Egyptian language it was known as ipet resyt, "the southern sanctuary". 
> It was one of the two primary temples on the east bank, the other being Karnak. 
> 
> Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god 
> or a deified version of the pharaoh in death.  
> 
> Instead, Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; 
> it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually 
> (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he was crowned at Luxor 
> but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo).
>
> To the rear of the temple are chapels built by Amenhotep III of the 18th Dynasty, and Alexander. 
> Other parts of the temple were built by Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. 
> 
> During the Roman era, the temple and its surroundings were a legionary fortress 
> and the home of the Roman government in the area. 
> 
> During the Roman period a chapel inside the Luxor Temple originally dedicated to the goddess Mut 
> was transformed into a Tetrarchy cult chapel and later into a church.
>
> Along with the other archeological sites in Thebes, 
> the Luxor Temple was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.
