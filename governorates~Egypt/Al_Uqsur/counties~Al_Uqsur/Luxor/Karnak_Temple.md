## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak, 
> comprises a vast mix of temples, pylons, chapels, and other buildings near Luxor, Egypt. 
> 
> Construction at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I (reigned 1971–1926 BC) 
> in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000–1700 BC) and continued into the Ptolemaic Kingdom (305–30 BC), 
> although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. 
> 
> The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian Ipet-isut ("The Most Selected of Places") 
> and the main place of worship of the 18th Dynastic Theban Triad, with the god Amun as its head. 
> 
> It is part of the monumental city of Thebes, 
> and in 1979 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the rest of the city. 
> Karnak gets its name from the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, 
> 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) north of Luxor.
