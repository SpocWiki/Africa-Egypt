> **Alexandria** (  AL-ig-ZA(H)N-dree-ə; Arabic: الإسكندرية) 
> is the second largest city in Egypt 
> and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. 
> 
> It lies at the western edge of the Nile River Delta. 
> Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, Alexandria grew rapidly 
> and became a major centre of Hellenic civilisation, 
> eventually replacing Memphis, in present-day Greater Cairo, 
> as Egypt's capital. 
> 
> Called the "Bride of the Mediterranean" 
> and "Pearl of the Mediterranean Coast" internationally, 
> Alexandria is a popular tourist destination and an important industrial centre 
> due to its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.
>
> The city extends about 40 km (25 mi) along the northern coast of Egypt 
> - and is the largest city on the Mediterranean, 
> - the second-largest in Egypt (after Cairo), 
> - the  fourth-largest city in the Arab world, 
> - the ninth-largest city in Africa, 
> - and the ninth-largest urban area in Africa.
>
> The city was founded originally in the vicinity of an Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis 
> (that became the Egyptian quarter of the city). 
> 
> Alexandria grew rapidly, becoming a major centre of Hellenic civilisation 
> and replacing Memphis as Egypt's capital 
> during the reign of the Ptolemaic pharaohs who succeeded Alexander. 
> 
> It retained this status for almost a millennium, 
> through the period of Roman and Eastern Roman rule 
> until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, 
> when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo).
>
> Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), 
> one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; 
> its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; 
> and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. 
> 
> Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural centre of the ancient Mediterranean 
> for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity. 
> It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world 
> before being eventually overtaken by Rome.
>
> The city was a major centre of early Christianity 
> and was the centre of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, 
> which was one of the major centres of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. 
> 
> In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church 
> and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage. 
> 
> By 641, the city had already been largely plundered 
> and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era. 
> 
> From the late 18th century, 
> Alexandria became a major centre of the international shipping industry 
> and one of the most important trading centres in the world, 
> both because it profited from the easy overland connection 
> between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.
