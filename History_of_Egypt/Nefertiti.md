## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Nefertiti** (c. 1370 – c. 1330 BC) was a queen of the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, 
> the great royal wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten. 
> 
> Nefertiti and her husband were known for their radical overhaul of state religious policy, 
> in which they promoted an exclusivist and possibly even monotheistic religion, 
> Atenism, centered on the sun disc and its direct connection to the royal household. 
> With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of ancient Egyptian history.
>
> After her husband's death, some scholars 
> believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as the female pharaoh 
> known by the throne name Neferneferuaten, and before the ascension of Tutankhamun, 
> although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate. 
> 
> If Nefertiti did rule as pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna 
> and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes.
>
> In the 20th century, Nefertiti was made famous by the discovery 
> and display of her ancient bust, now in Berlin's Neues Museum. 
> The bust is one of the most copied works of the art of ancient Egypt. 
> 
> It is attributed to the Egyptian sculptor Thutmose, 
> and was excavated from his buried studio complex in the early 20th century.
