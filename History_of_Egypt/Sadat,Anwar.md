> Muhammad Anwar es-Sadat (25 December 1918 – 6 October 1981) 
> was an Egyptian politician and military officer who served as the third president of Egypt, 
> from 15 October 1970 
> until his assassination by members of the Islamic Jihad on 6 October 1981. 
> 
> Sadat was a senior member of the Free Officers 
> who overthrew King Farouk I in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, 
> and a close confidant of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, 
> under whom he served as vice president twice 
> and whom he succeeded as president in 1970. 
> 
> In 1978, Sadat and Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel, 
> signed a peace treaty in cooperation with United States President Jimmy Carter, 
> for which they were recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize.
>
> In his 11 years as president, he changed Egypt's trajectory, 
> departing from many political and economic tenets of Nasserism, 
> reinstituting a multi-party system, and launching the Infitah economic policy. 
> 
> As President, he led Egypt in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to regain Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, 
> which Israel had occupied since the Six-Day War of 1967, 
> making him a hero in Egypt and, for a time, the wider Arab World. 
> 
> Afterwards, he engaged in negotiations with Israel, 
> culminating in the Camp David Accords and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty.
>
> Although reaction to the treaty – which resulted in the return of Sinai to Egypt – 
> was generally favorable among Egyptians, 
> it was rejected by the country's Muslim Brotherhood and the left, 
> which felt Sadat had abandoned efforts to ensure a State of Palestine. 
> 
> With the exception of Sudan, 
> the Arab world and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
> strongly opposed Sadat's efforts to make a separate peace with Israel 
> without prior consultations with the Arab states. 
> 
> His refusal to reconcile with them over the Palestinian issue 
> resulted in Egypt being suspended from the Arab League from 1979 to 1989. 
> 
> The peace treaty was also one of the primary factors that led to his assassination; 
> on 6 October 1981, militants led by Khalid Al-Islambuli 
> opened fire on Sadat with automatic rifles during the 6 October parade in Cairo, 
> killing him.
