> Saint Catherine's Monastery (Arabic: دير القدّيسة كاترين Dayr al-Qiddīsa Katrīn, 
> Greek: Ιερά Μονή Αγίας Αικατερίνης Όρους Σινά, romanized: Iërá Moní Ayías Ekaterínis Órus Siná), 
> officially the Sacred Autonomous Royal Monastery of Saint Catherine 
> of the Holy and God-Trodden Mount Sinai, 
> is a Christian monastery located in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. 
> Located at the foot of Mount Sinai, it was built between 548 and 565, 
> and is the world's oldest continuously inhabited Christian monastery. 
>
> The monastery was built by order of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, 
> enclosing what is claimed to be the burning bush seen by Moses. 
> 
> Centuries later, the purported body of Catherine of Alexandria, 
> said to have been found in the area, was taken to the monastery; 
> Catherine's relics turned it into an important Christian pilgrimage, 
> and the monastery was eventually renamed after the saint.
>
> Controlled by the autonomous Church of Sinai, which is part of the wider Greek Orthodox Church, the monastery became a World Heritage Site in 2002 for its unique importance to the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The monastery includes a Fatimid mosque built in 1106 AD that is still preserved. 
>
> The monastery library holds unique and rare works, such as the Codex Sinaiticus and the Syriac Sinaiticus, as well as a collection of early Christian icons, including the earliest known depiction of Christ Pantocrator.
>
> Saint Catherine's has as its backdrop the three mountains it lies near: Willow Peak (possibly the biblical Mount Horeb, peak c.1 km (0.62 mi) west); Jebel Arrenziyeb, peak c. 1km south; and Mount Sinai (locally, Jabal Musa, by tradition identified with the biblical Mount Sinai; peak c. 2 km (1.2 mi) south).
