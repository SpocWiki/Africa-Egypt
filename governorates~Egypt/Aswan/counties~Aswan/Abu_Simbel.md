> Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples 
> in the village of Abu Simbel (Arabic: أبو سمبل), Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, 
> near the border with Sudan. 
> 
> It is located on the western bank of Lake Nasser, 
> about 230 km (140 mi) southwest of Aswan (about 300 km (190 mi) by road). 
> 
> The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside 
> in the 13th century BC, during the 19th Dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II. 
> 
> Their huge external rock relief figures of Ramesses II have become iconic. 
> His wife, Nefertari, and children can be seen in smaller figures by his feet. 
> Sculptures inside the Great Temple commemorate Ramesses II's heroic leadership 
> at the Battle of Kadesh.
>
> The complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968 to higher ground 
> to avoid it being submerged by Lake Nasser, the Aswan Dam reservoir. 
> 
> As part of the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, 
> an artificial hill was made from a domed structure to house the Abu Simbel Temples, 
> under the supervision of a Polish archaeologist, Kazimierz Michałowski, 
> from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw.
>
> The Abu Simbel complex, and other relocated temples from Nubian sites 
> such as Philae, Amada, Wadi es-Sebua, 
> are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Nubian Monuments.
